\subsection{Conditional Diffusion Models} \label{sec:conditional_diff}
In this section, the details are explained how the diffusion models can be conditioned. Conditioning a generative model means to control the output given some extra input. This input can be text describing an image \cite{rombach_high-resolution_2022}, or part on an image for inpainting \cite{rombach_high-resolution_2022} The extra input $\mathbf{c}$ is sometimes called the covariates but often times the conditional input. Diffusion models can be conditioned in two different ways. Firstly in section \ref{sec:conditional_diff_model}, during training, by inputting the condition $\mathbf{c}$ into the model and training accordingly \cite{ho_cascaded_2021}. Secondly in section \ref{sec:conditional_diff_guidance}, there is Diffusion Guidance, a novel approach that shifts the conditioning from training to the inference stage, leveraging the Bayes rule \cite{song_score-based_2021}.
